To rotate rectangle \( A \) \( 90^{\degree} \) clockwise and obtain rectangle \( B \) correctly positioned, the center of rotation cannot be the origin, unless rectangle \( B \)'s position relative to the origin is explicitly stated and matches that outcome.

1) \(2x + 3y = 6\)
2) \( x - y = 4\)","To solve for \(x\) and \(y\), we can multiply the second equation by 3 to eliminate \(y\) when we add the equations:
Multiply the second equation by 3:
\(3(x - y) = 3(4)\)
Which gives us:
\(3x - 3y = 12\)

Now, add this equation to the first one:
\(2x + 3y = 6\) 
\(+\)
\(3x - 3y = 12\)
---------------
\(5x = 18\)

Solving for \(x\):
\(x = \frac{18}{5}\)

Now, substitute the value of \(x\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(y\). Using the second equation:
\(x - y = 4\)
\(\frac{18}{5} - y = 4\)
\(-y = 4 - \frac{18}{5}\)
\(-y = \frac{20}{5} - \frac{18}{5}\)
\(-y = \frac{2}{5}\)

So, \(y = -\frac{2}{5}\).

Thus, the solutions are \(x = \frac{18}{5}\) and \(y = -\frac{2}{5}\).","If the student mistakenly adds a variable to one of the equations to make terms identical without properly applying a method to eliminate one of the variables, they might proceed as follows:

Misunderstanding might lead to directly adding \(x\) to the second equation without any justification to make the coefficients of \(x\) identical in both equations, forming an incorrect system:
1) \(2x + 3y = 6\)
2*) \( x + x - y = 4 + x\)

This misunderstanding can lead to an incorrect equation like \(2x - y = 4 + x\), which does not follow any method of solving simultaneous equations and would lead to incorrect solutions.

If Mike decides to distribute the candies among 2 children and then considers distributing the candies among 4 children, how does the amount of candy each child receives change with the number of children?","Dividing the candies among fewer children means each child gets more candies.

The correct transformation should include addition or subtraction to isolate the variables: \( x \equiv y - 3 \) by rearranging terms correctly such that both sides of the equation are equivalent. Initially, \( x + 5 \equiv y + 2 \), implies \( x \equiv y + 2 - 5 \), resulting in \( x \equiv y - 3 \) correctly.",The claim is correct.

\[
\begin{array}{l}

\end{array}
\]

Solving for \(x\), we find:
\[x = 5\]

Substitute \(x = 5\) back into the first equation to solve for \(y\):
\[3(5) + 4y = 24\]
\[15 + 4y = 24\]
\[4y = 9\]
\[y = \frac{9}{4}\]

Therefore, the values are \(x = 5\) and \(y = \frac{9}{4}\).","According to the misconception, the student believes the equations cannot be eliminated because the signs of the \(y\) coefficients differ. Thus, they might erroneously attempt to transform the equations unnecessarily, perhaps by multiplying one equation by -1 to change the sign of \(5x - 4y = 16\), mistakenly giving:
\[
\begin{array}{l}
3x + 4y = 24 \\

Convert from mixed number fractions to improper fractions,Converting Mixed Number and Improper Fractions,Convert \( 5 \frac{3}{4} \) to an improper fraction.,\( \frac{23}{4} \),\( \frac{20}{4} \),Forgets to add the numerator when converting from a mixed number to an improper fraction ,2579
Understanding distinction between angle measurement and distance measurement,Geometry and Trigonometry,Calculate the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle where one angle is 30° and the adjacent side is 5 cm.,Using the cosine function: \( \text{Cos}(30^\circ) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} \rightarrow \frac{5}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) leading to \(\text{Hypotenuse} = \frac{5 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 5.77 \) cm.,"\(30^\circ\) implies using the angle directly to miscalculate length, such as stating Hypotenuse \( = 30 \) cm.",Believes degrees can be used to measure length,2580
Factorise a quadratic expression in the form ax² + bx + c,Factorising into a Double Bracket,Factorise \( 6x^2 - 5x - 6 \),\( (3x + 2)(2x - 3) \),\( (3x - 2)(2x + 3) \),"When factorising a quadratic with a coefficient of x squared, believes the signs and/or positions of the constants are interchangeable",2581
Apply the properties of exponents,Exponents and Powers,What is the result of \((3^2) \times (3^3)\)?,\(3^5\) or \(243\),\(3^6\) or \(729\),"When multiplying numbers with the same base, multiplies the powers ",2582
Recognise cube numbers,"Squares, Cubes, etc","Select the cube number from the following options: \(9, 12, 27, 35\)",\( 27 \),\( 9 \),Does not know what a cube number is,2583
Comparison of Percentages of Different Quantities,Understanding Percentages and Proportions,James believes that 30% of 70 will always be greater than 60% of 40. Is he correct? Calculate both percentages and determine which is larger.,"No, James is not correct. \(30\%\) of \(70\) is \(21\) and \(60\%\) of \(40\) is \(24\). Therefore, \(60\%\) of \(40\) is greater.","Yes, James is correct. He believes that since \(70 > 40\), \(30\%\) of \(70\) is greater than \(60\%\) of \(40\).",Believes that any percentage of a larger number will be greater than any percentage of a smaller number,2584
Expand products of three binomials in the form (x + a)(x + b)(x + c),Expanding Triple Brackets and more,"When David expands these brackets, how many terms should he get after he simplifies?\\ (q+7)(q+3)(q+6)",4,3,Believes a cubic expression should have three terms,2585
Interpreting the order of operations in nested expressions,Nested Operations,Simplify the expression: \((8 - 2) \times [5 - (3 + 2)]\),\( (8 - 2) \times [5 - 5] = 0 \),\( 6 \times 5 - 3 + 2 = 29 \),Misunderstands order of operations in algebraic expressions,2586
