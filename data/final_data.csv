Find missing angles in a triangle,Angles in Triangles,"What is the size of angle \( p \) in the triangle below? <br> (Given angles: \( 49^{\circ} \) and \( 51^{\circ} \)) <br> ![A triangle with angles labelled 49 degrees, 51 degrees, and p [not to scale]]",\( 80^{\circ} \),Not enough information,"When students claim there is ""not enough information"" to find angle \(p\), it indicates a fundamental gap in their understanding of triangle properties. They may be feeling uncertain and confused, possibly because they haven't internalized the concept that the sum of the angles in any triangle always equals \(180^{\circ}\). 

Their thought process might involve:
- **Overthinking the problem**: They might be grappling with the specific values given (49° and 51°) and mistakenly believe these values are insufficient without a third angle, leading to hesitation in making a conclusion.
- **Fear of making mistakes**: Some students might be overly cautious and refrain from performing calculations if they think they do not fully understand the material, leading to a defensive response of saying there’s not enough information.
- **Misinterpretation of the data**: They likely miss the critical detail that the problem's nature inherently guarantees that the missing angle can be calculated from the provided angles, as they don't recognize that the known values are adequate for determining the unknown.

This misconception points towards a deeper need for clarity in concepts related to triangles, reinforcing the importance of consistent practice in applying basic geometric principles.",Does not know that angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees
Multiply Proper and Improper Fractions,Multiplying Fractions,\( \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{2}{5}=? \),\( \frac{3 \times 2}{4 \times 5} = \frac{6}{20} = \frac{3}{10} \),\( 3 + 2 = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad 4 + 5 = 9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{5}{9} \),"When attempting to solve the multiplication of fractions \(\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{2}{5}\), the student likely encountered the task with some confusion regarding how to operate with fractions. Instead of recognizing that they needed to multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together, they might have unconsciously reverted to a method familiar for adding fractions – mistakenly thinking that fractions could be combined by simply adding their numerators and denominators. This misunderstanding could stem from a lack of clear differentiation between the operations of addition and multiplication in the context of fractions. Internally, the student might be thinking, “I know how to add fractions; let me try that,” thereby arriving at the incorrect result of \(\frac{5}{9}\) rather than the correct answer. This reflects a possible overgeneralization of prior knowledge, which can hinder their proficiency when faced with different mathematical operations. Each time they encountered a fraction problem, their subconscious may have prompted them to draw from what they felt most comfortable with, leading to systematic errors in their approach.",Uses dividing fractions method for multiplying fractions
