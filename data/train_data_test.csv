1868,"Describe a 90° or 270° rotation giving the angle and direction of rotation, and the coordinates of the centre of rotation, where the centre of rotation lies on the edge or outside of the object ",Rotation,B,"Jo and Paul are arguing about how to fully describe the rotation from shape \( P \) to shape \( Q \)

Jo says: ""a rotation of \( 90^{\degree} \) anticlockwise""

Paul says: ""a rotation of \( +270^{\degree} \) about \( (-1,1)^{\prime \prime} \)

Who is correct? ![A coordinate grid with two trapeziums drawn on it and a centre of rotation marked on, one space to the right and one space up from the origin. Trapezium P has the coordinates: (-4,4) (-2,4) (-2,3) and (-4,1). Trapezium Q has the coordinates: (-4,-2) (-4,0) (-3,0) and (-1,-2).]()",Only Paul,AnswerDText,Neither is correct,95.0
